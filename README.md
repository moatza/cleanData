The cleanData repository contains:
•	README.md (Instructions on using the run_analysis.R script)
•	run_analysis.R (R file containing the main script) 
•	“UCI HAR Dataset” directory where the data for the project is stored
•	project_code_book.md (The code book describing the variables)
•	tidy_data_set.txt (A tidy data set resulting from running the run_analysis.R script)

Instructions:
-	Download the Samsung data and unzip it under “UCI HAR Dataset” directory. 
-	Use features.txt for columns names
-	Read from the given files the data sets
-	merge dataframes to create one data set
-	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
-	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
-	Creates a second, independent tidy data set, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
